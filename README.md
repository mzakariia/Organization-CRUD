# Organization-CRUD

This project was part of an internship I participated in.

The purpose of this project is to test and create different database relationships between the project's entites.

The relationships included in the project are:
- 1-1
- 1-many
- many - 1
- many-many

CRUD operations were performed on all entites.

Tests are availble in the tests package that test all the services available in this project.
